# AA-AIO-TWEAKER

The ultimate All-In-One Utility to tweak Android Auto behaviour.

# How do I use it?

Allow root access, choose what you want, reboot, and then forget about it :)

# How does it work?

This app uses SQLite commands to override some flags related to Android Auto into the Google Play Services. 

Google Play Services control a lot of features inside Android Auto. Some of them are core functionality of Android Auto, some of them are upcoming feature that are simply not yet released.

What this app does is making some SQLite queries in order to alter some features of Android Auto. 

# Example of available commands

- Patch for custom Android Auto apps
- Disable speed restrictions while driving (preview of messages will be shown always)
- Disable six tap limit (the banner asking to pay attention to road will not be shown anymore)
- Disable launch of Navigator app at start
- Disable bluetooth auto connection
- Enable force Widescreen (or force disable it)
- Disable unnecessary telemetry
- Set notification duration from 0ms to 20 seconds
- Set media notification duration on Navbar to up to 15 minutes
- Enable MultiDisplay and clustersim feature

And much more :)

# How is this different from AA Phenotype Patcher?

AA AIO TWEAKER is a fork of AA Phenotype Patcher and a lot of the original source has been re-used for coding this app. As of January 2021, with the new Android Auto 6.0 update, AA AIO TWEAKER provides a new method to patch Android Auto custom apps that is new and not available (yet) on AA Phenotype Patcher. If you are interested in patching custom apps, you might want to use AA AIO TWEAKER instead.

# Can I use this app instead of AA Phenotype Patcher?

Yes you can. If you are on Android Auto 6.0 or superior, be sure to re-do the patch of custom apps. This is because AA Phenotype Patcher has not been updated with the new methods.

# How is this different from Sensible Android Auto: Xposed?

This app doesn't need Xposed, which in some cases is one more pain to have. Also, it should survive Android Auto updates (unless the flag are changed) without any user modification.

# Can I use this app instead of Sensible Android Auto: Xposed?

Yes, you can. The functionaility is the same, the only "advantage" is not having to install Xposed to make it work. This app won't check if you have SAAX installed so you won't have a green check status at the start. If you are familiar with SAAX and you want to keep it, you may not want to disable speed limitation and six tap with this app.
